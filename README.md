# Image_Pixels
This Project came to me while i was doing another project which depends on some images that have to be all equal dimensions. so i got the idea to crop an image using python that can crop the `BIG` Image into smaller one with its Original-Quality.
This version shows:
- Position of each pixel of the image by putting the mouse's cursor on it and it will show its position as the image below:

- if i want to crop the image into smaller one

- There also a show positions which i clicked from the beginning:

- and finally the cropping and it works only on the last two clicks `position` i did

first position (x,y) should be on top left of the image.
second position (x,y) should be bottom right of the image.
